Toast notifications for every user action

No backend. No assumptions. No unresolved placeholders.

OTP verification (dummy OTP logic)

Session persistence using localStorage

Logout and session clearing

User Profile

Mandatory profile completion flow

Profile edit

3. UI Behavior You Must Decide & Implement

Toast messages (success, error, warning)

Position, color, and duration of toasts

Empty state messages/illustrations

Skeleton loaders while data loads

Error states for invalid or blocked actions

No UI interaction should feel incomplete.

4. Data Management Rules

You must:

Store all data in localStorage

Create realistic dummy data for:

Users

Persist data across refresh

Clear all data on logout

No external APIs.

6. Platform Rules You Must Enforce in UI

7. Quality Bar

The final UI must:

Contain no dead ends or broken flows

Function fully using dummy data only

You are expected to make all reasonable UI decisions within this scope and deliver a complete, cohesive, working frontend experience.
